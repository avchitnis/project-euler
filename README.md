# Brief description
This repository contains my solutions to the first 10 questions on the [project euler website](https://projecteuler.net/)

# Details
- Each problem themselves as well as my solution has been placed in its own file
  - You can find these files within the `project euler` folder of this repository

# Reflection
- The problems are quite challenging, both mathematically and when programing their solutions
  - This has encouraged me to develop my thinking when approaching new problems

I would certainly recommend these to anyone who wishes to test themselves!
