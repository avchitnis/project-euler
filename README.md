# Brief description
This repository contains my solutions to the first 10 questions on the project euler website

# Details
- Each problem as well as my solution has been placed in its own file
- You can find these files within the `project-euler` folder

# Reflection
- The problems are quite challenging, both mathematically and when programing their solutions
  - This has encouraged me to develop my thinking when approaching new problems
